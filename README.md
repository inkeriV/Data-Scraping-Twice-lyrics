# Twice lyrics üç≠

This is my own project for practicing data scraping. I have the same code as a notebook and a .py file. Both build a dataset with all Twice song lyrics romanized and in Korean/Japanese and English. Lyric source is [azlyrics.com](https://www.azlyrics.com/t/twice.html).

The finished dataset in on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inkeriv/all-twice-song-lyrics-dataset/data)!
